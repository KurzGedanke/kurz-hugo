# kurz-hugo

This is my personal written Hugo-Theme with the base of bootstrap. It is nothing fancy, but this was one part of it. Keep it simple and make it purple. 

The theme is copyrighted by me (KurzGedanke), but still it is Open Source, so that you can view it and learn something or just wondering what the heck I'm doing here. It is ok if you (as a person, not a company or with big financial intrests) use snippits from my code. I just don't want to see that somebody else uses exactly my personal theme. Thank you for this! 

I'm by far not an hugo expert, but the writting gave me a little inside view of theming hugo (of course it does...), so if you want to write your own hugo theme and you don't know where to start, just ask away. I'm gald to help :)
