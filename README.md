# kurz-hugo

This is my personal written Hugo-Theme with the base of bootstrap. It is nothing fancy, but this was one part of it. Keep it simple and make it purple.

I'm by far not an hugo expert, but the writting gave me a little inside view of theming hugo (of course it does...), so if you want to write your own hugo theme and you don't know where to start, just ask away. I'm gald to help :)
